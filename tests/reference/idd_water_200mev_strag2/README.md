Straggling distal-edge benchmark — 200 MeV protons in water, STRAGG 2 (Vavilov)
===============================================================================

Part of the issue #190 set (idd_water_200mev_strag0/strag1/strag2); see
../idd_water_200mev_strag0/README for the shared phantom, beam, scoring and
reference-setup description.

This case: STRAGG 2 (Vavilov energy straggling), MSCAT off, NUCRE off.

STRAGG 2 (Vavilov + Landau) is now implemented in OpenShieldHIT, so the
transport path no longer aborts with OSH_ENOTSUP. No reference/ curve is committed yet, so
the CTest entry still SKIPS (the harness checks for reference data before
running openshieldhit). Once an SH12A Vavilov curve is added to reference/, this
case will actively compare against it.
