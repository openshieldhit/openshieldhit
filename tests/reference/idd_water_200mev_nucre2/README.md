NUCRE isolation benchmark — 200 MeV protons in water, NUCRE 2 (elastic only)
===========================================================================

Part of the issue #212 set (idd_water_200mev_nucre0/1/2/3); see
../idd_water_200mev_nucre0/README for the shared phantom, beam, scoring and the
role of each NUCRE mode.

This case: NUCRE 2 — elastic nuclear scattering only, no inelastic channel.
OSH-only diagnostic (SH12A has no NUCRE 2), so there is no SH12A mirror deck and
tools/plot_nucre.py shows this mode as OpenShieldHIT-only.  Currently the elastic
channel is p+p (hydrogen) only, so the secondary yield here is small and there
are no heavy recoils — closing that gap (p+A elastic → recoiling C/O nuclei) is
the subject of issue #212.  Together with nucre3 this decomposes NUCRE 1.
