================

400 MeV/nucleon carbon-12 pencil beam in a water cylinder (R=10 cm, L=40 cm).
10000 primaries, Moliere scattering, Vavilov straggling, nuclear reactions on.

Scoring covers mesh (MSH, 1x1x40 cm, 800 z-bins) and cylinder (CYL, R=11.85 cm,
800 z-bins) geometries.  Scored quantities: Energy, Fluence.

Filters defined (not active in current outputs):
  Primary  — generation 0, Z=1 A=1 protons only
  Protons  — all protons regardless of generation

Settings defined (not active in current outputs):
  in_Water — material override: Water

Output in both TEXT and BDO formats.
